I created this project out of curiosity and fun along with learning.
I have used MobileNetV2 model from tensorflow library for binary classification.
The dataset mainly has three image folder train,test and validate which further has subfolders chihuahua and muffin.
It is a labelled dataset so no need to worry for splitting each image.
Dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification .
Big thumbs up to the creator.
